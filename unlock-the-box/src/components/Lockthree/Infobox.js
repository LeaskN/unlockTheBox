                    The old paradigm of the classroom: lecturer poised confidently at the front of the room, gesturing
                    toward the presentation notes projected onto the whiteboard. Pages of anecdotes and explanations
                    pour from the speaker’s mouth, weaving a tapestry of data and formulations. Meanwhile, students stare
                    blankly, the foreheads of some meld into the tables, others doodle aimlessly or are swiping through
                    social media. This is “learning”.

                    challenges, We Connect The Dots in partnership with Nebula Academy
                    have created an “Unlock The Box” experience to teach the basics of Software Development.

                    Working in groups, students will will have one hour to complete the gambit of locks. Meanwhile,
                    the students are scrambling, delegating, and researching in a flurry of activity as they try to open all the
                    locks before time runs out!
